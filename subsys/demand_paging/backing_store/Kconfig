config BACKING_STORE_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom backing store implementation"
	help
	  This option is chosen when the backing store will be implemented in
	  the application. This will be typical as these tend to be very
	  hardware-dependent.

config BACKING_STORE_RAM
	bool "RAM-based test backing store"
	help
	  This implements a backing store using physical RAM pages that the Zephyr
	  kernel is otherwise unaware of. It is intended for demonstration and
	  testing of the demand paging feature. It requires additional RAM to be
	  physically present beyond CONFIG_SRAM_SIZE that at least KERNEL_VM_SIZE.
